# Audio Widgets

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/bbmsoft/audio-widgets.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/github/bbmsoft/audio-widgets)

A collection of audio related UI widgets for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Currently contains only implementations for [Yew](https://yew.rs/), but other frameworks may be supported in the future.

Very early development stage, expect breaking changes anytime.
